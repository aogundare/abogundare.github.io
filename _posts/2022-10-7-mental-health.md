## Truth and  Misinformation 
Social media can affect your mind by giving false information. Young kids are at the age where they are more likely to be succumbed to peer pressure and susceptible at false information. Their mind is not fully developed which creates a huge problem when combined with having countless hours of social media activity. These activities can be scams, as well as provide not inappropriate content and many more are giving  misleading information that can influence their personality and thus, creating a false reality of life.

	This video behind this image is a perfect example of the importance of misleading information. Lois learns about how vaccinations are made, she is very concerned about her son having a vaccination. Thus she decides not to allow her kid to have his vaccine and more importantly takes actions for other parents to join their anti vaccination rally. This creates a huge problem in their town because soon after a public heath crisis takes over the whole town.    

Sometimes your actions although with good intentions can make the situation worse as well as hurt yourself or your family in the process.
