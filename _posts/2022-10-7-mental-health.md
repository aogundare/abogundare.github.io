## Truth and  Misinformation 
Social media can affect your mind by giving false information. Young kids are at the age where they are more likely to be succumbed to peer pressure and more susceptible to false information.These activities can provide inappropriate content and give misleading information that can influence their personality at such a young age and create a false perspective of life.

This video behind this image is a perfect example of the importance of misleading information. Lois learns about how vaccinations are made, she is very concerned about her son having a vaccination.  This creates a huge problem in their town because soon after a public heath crisis takes over the whole town because of her intention of protecting her child.

Sometimes your actions, although with good intentions can make the situation worse as well as hurt yourself or your family in the process.
