## Misinformation 
Social media can affect your mind by giving false information. Young kids are at the age where they are more likely to be succumbed to peer pressure and susceptible at false information. Their mind is not fully developed which creates a huge problem when combined with having countless hours of social media activity. These activities can be scams, as well as provide not inappropriate content and many misleading facts that can influence their personality and values creating a false reality of life.
